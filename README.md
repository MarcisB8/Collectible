# Collectible
This is Project 2 of my IvanOnTech Academy journey. It is a smart contract which can be used to mint data as NFT token.

At the moment, such technology is mostly used for visual collectibles. Considering that, the frontend is created in a way that the data minted would be a link to an image, and then this image would be retrieved when needed. This could happen on an application or marketplace where the frontend supports this. For testing purposes, a webpage and necessary script is included in this repository.

The smart contract is deployed on Ropsten testnet and is free to use. If there was a need to monetize, the _mint()_ function could be _payable_, so a pre-defined amount of payment would be requested.
